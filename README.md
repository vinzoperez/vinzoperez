- 👋 Hi, I’m Vinzo!
- 🚲 I have a lot of hobbies really, coding is just one of them!
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python 🐍 and C++ 🧠
- 📖 I have experience in lua / Roblox Game Development, Java, C#, and C++ although i do love me lua the most!
- 📫 While this is just a side hobby I will try my best to update any active projects.
- 📘 I suppose I lean towards the Game Development side, I always loved working on games since they are such a key part of my childhood, as a gamer myself who loves to exploit games and find cruical bugs. I grew a passion towards making my own.
  I also am really interested in learning how to make Reinforcement AI to learn how to play games, I have yet to start any project like this but I want to attempt it! Hopefully I will acheive this in 2025 with python.

- ⚡ Fun fact: I tend to just play games instead of doing projects.
